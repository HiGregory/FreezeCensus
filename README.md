# Background

Freeze is a winning ABA Justice Hack 2018 idea based on using technology and design to help people understand what public safety officers have to go through in their daily lives. This is Freeze Census which will be the data portal where we collect information on municiaplities. It will be used as the knoweldge center and where we pull statistics for the Freeze app. 

# Configuring

This app is an HTML/CSS/JS app that has slight interactions but purpose is to store data.

This is a refork of a Police Census project that was open-source several years back.
